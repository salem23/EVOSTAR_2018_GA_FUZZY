This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolution, we intend to improve a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed and steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process.
In this paper, an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm - with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller.
The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice (without rivals) and real races.
%Pablo: compared with other controllers? Explain
% Antonio - Now it's clear I think
The improved fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any
autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the starting fuzzy-controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.
% Antonio - I have rewritten this. Mohammed, check if this is true. ;)

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Autonomous driving is a very interesting research topic recently
supported by many vehicle manufacturers. The final aim is to create
real self-driving cars that can move in everyday roads and streets or, for
that matter, in a desert or hostile environment. This objective is
complemented with the reduction of fuel consumption and the
maximization of its efficient use, along with the car safety and the
driver comfort in some cases; all these improvements with the implied
constraint that no accidents should take place.  

Optimization in car racing games can be situated in that context, with
solutions obtained there having utility beyond the game itself; this
explains the popularity of car racing games challenges, which are
usually performed using game simulators. The Open Racing Car Simulator
(TORCS) \cite{WebTORCS} is a realistic racing simulator with a
sophisticated engine used for many standalone racing competition
challenges every year. This fact, combined with the large gaming
community and the ability to compare controllers, have made TORCS the
most used simulator in the field of autonomous driving \cite{LFAG,Guadarrama2008,SAES2012,Floreano2004}. 

Many kinds of controllers have been used in this simulator, but one of the most efficient controllers so far are fuzzy-based ones, as they simulate in part the human reasoning when driving \cite{CarRacing_Pelta09,PerezEvolvingFuzzy09,torcs2012}. 

In this line, the authors presented previously an approach in which two specialised fuzzy controllers were combined to decide the car's steering angle and desired speed in every single point (or tick) during a race \cite{evo17_blind}.  
% Antonio - Mohammed, was these factors computed every small amount of time or just in some parts of the track, such as in every curve?
% Mohammed - They are computed every race tick ( we have any previous knowledge about the track parts: straight or curves)
% Antonio - Ok, written. ;)

The obtained results were promising, but the performance of the autonomous driver showed some flaws in difficult tracks - those with many curves, or where `external' factors affected the asphalt - and against the most competitive rivals. 

We argue here that the major disadvantage of this approach is that the parameters of the controllers' fuzzy membership functions were defined following a trial/error process in the absence of experts to do so.
Thus, in this work we consider the selection of the best values for these parameters as an optimization problem, so we have applied an evolutionary algorithm to obtain them. Concretely, we propose to apply a real-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) \cite{realcodedGA1998} with this purpose. The considered approach requires, in addition to a good codification of solutions and selection of operators, the choice of an adequate cost function (fitness), due to the uncertainty and noisiness of the problem itself. So two different proposals have been studied.

The genetic-fuzzy based controller has been evaluated in a practice race - without rivals - first, and then in a real race against different drivers in TORCS.
The obtained results show that the enhanced controllers (one per fitness function) perform both much better than the original fuzzy controller (previously presented) in the practice race, increasing the top speed while they are not damaged, and obtaining a very good lap time.
In addition, they compete very well against tough rivals, getting a rank 2 or 3 in the race with a time close to the winner and a very low received damage.

So, we can conclude from these results that the proposed approach successfully evolves the fuzzy controller membership parameters giving good performances in terms of damage avoidance and race time. This suggest that GAs with the proposed fitness functions are well-suited for finding the best trade-off between the two objectives of any racing controller: damage and speed.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  STATE OF THE ART  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:soa}

% Revise the state of the art so that it tells something, and is not only "this guy does this, while that guy does that". It has to establish the "state of the art", what is being done in the area so that we prove that it's an improvement.

% Antonio - I have tried to improve the SotA, but there are still some missing clarifications

Evolutionary algorithms have been used by several researchers in many different ways in the car racing simulator TORCS.

For instance, Loiacono et al \cite{AutogenEvo2011} applied a single-objective and a multi-objective real-coded GA to the automatic generation of tracks for high-end racing games. 
%while \cite{Montecarlo2016} proposes a new framework of applying Monte Carlo Tree Search to the simulated car racing by  building the search tree in a discretized game-state space and then determine the action from the selected target game state to avoid the need to discretize the action space. 
% Antonio - Not an EA. ;)

Floreano et al. \cite{Floreano2004}, used a GA for tuning up a neural network which visually recognizes edges, corners and height, resembling strategies observed in simple insects which obtained results that performed equal or better than well trained human drivers tested on the same circuits. 

Another application of evolutionary algorithms was to determine the optimal trajectory of a lap in a known circuit \cite{drivingGA2008}, but this approach suffers from the problem that the obtained trajectory in the evolving process strongly depends on the initial state of the car. 
In the same context, the authors in \cite{GaRaceLine2010} tried to design a novel approach to compute the optimal racing line without any human intervention, using a GA to find the best trade-off between
the minimization of two conflicting objectives: the length and
the curvature of the racing line.

However, definitely, the most prolific area of application of EAs inside TORCS, has been the optimization of autonomous controllers for car driving, i.e. conducting a meta-optimization process.
Thus, EAs have been applied to `refine' the parameters which define the driver's behaviour \cite{ButzCMAES09,SAES2012}, or to improve the structure/architecture of the models \cite{evol,neurone}, working offline, or online (during the game) \cite{TanOnline08,Cardamone_Online_NN}. 

% FUZZY + EAs
Our approach is focused in this line, proposing the application of an off-line genetic algorithm for the improvement of the parameters which determine the behaviour of a controller for TORCS. However, we have focused on a Fuzzy-based model, as it is one of the best options for modelling human-like decisions (and actions). Some others authors have also used this kind of technique in the literature.

For instance, in \cite{Guadarrama2008}, a fuzzy rule-based car controller for a Car Racing Competition was built and tuned with co-evolutionary genetic algorithms. Two fuzzy controllers were designed (acceleration and turning angle). But this approach was applied to a simpler simulator than TORCS. 
%Pablo: Explain why our approach is better, because TORCS is more complicated

Pérez et al. presented an evolutionary fuzzy approach for TORCS in \cite{PerezEvolvingFuzzy09}, where they applied EAs for improving fuzzy models to infer the acceleration and turning angle. However, the models were not so specialized like the proposed here.
% Antonio - please Mohammed, explain this better

Onieva et al.,\cite{LFAG} presented a parametrized modular architecture with a fuzzy system and a GA in the design of fuzzy logic controllers for steering wheel management that can reproduce human driver behaviour but it did not take the target speed in account. 
% Say something about how we are going to improve on that - JJ. Pablo: and link with the next paragraph

In this paper, we propose to optimize the parameters of the membership functions of two specialized fuzzy controllers for TORCS, which compute the steering angle and the target speed of the car in the track. 
% Antonio - why is this proposal better than the previous ones?


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Thus, in \cite{SAES2012}, the authors design a competitive driving controller in TORCS  by optimizing the parameters of an autonomous car controller using self adaptive evolutionary strategies (SAESs) which co-evolve solutions and mutation steps for each parameter. 
%Pablo: how we can use this referene to validate ours? Which is our selling-point/differenciation?


% Make a statement about the "state of the art", like "in general, EAs
% have obtained good results with the constraint of the underlying
% controller that is being optimiize - JJ

% If you are introducing another topic, you have to relate with the
% previous paragraph - JJ

% Always "narrate" the SoA relating every paragraph with the previous one
%EAs have been also used to optimize fuzzy set parameters, %Pablo: In TORCS?
%although the maximum values of the sets may not be achieved following this approach \cite{PerezEvolvingFuzzy09}. %Pablo: why?
%In that work, the authors obtain improved fuzzy models to infer the acceleration and turning angle, but they are not specialized as the proposed here. %Pablo: try to explain it better

\section{TORCS Description}
\label{sec:torcs}
% Antonio - I have reduced it, as we have now more than 16 pages. We could remove the tables if needed.
The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) \cite{WebTORCS} is an open source, modern, multi-player, modular and portable racing simulator that allows users to race against computer-controlled opponents. 

Its high degree of modularity and portability, together with the realistic and real-time driving simulation, make it an ideal testbed for artificial intelligence research, as it can be seen in the literature. 
The game offers different types of races from the practical single session to the championship.

There is a large set of sensors \cite{Torcs3} which the car can consider during a race, such as distances to track borders, to rivals, current fuel, current gear, position in the race, speed, or damage, among others.

Hence, a controller is a program, which runs inside TORCS, that automatically drives a car. It gets as input information about the current state of the car and its situation on the track (sensors). These collected data are used to decide actions to perform in the next simulation tick.
	
	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  FUZZY CONTROLLER  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	\section{Fuzzy Controller}
	\label{sec:fuzzy_controller}

% Antonio - I reduce and rewrite this section as it is the same as in previus work.

The initial proposed controller \cite{evo17_blind} has the same modular architecture as the simple driver of TORCS, however, the target speed and steering angle are computed by means of two modular and specialised fuzzy sub-controllers, which consider five position sensors. This is the controller which will be improved by means of a GA.

The two sub-controllers are summarized in the following subsections.

%-----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Fuzzy target speed sub-controller}

This controller aims to estimate the optimal target speed of the car, both in straight parts and curves of the track, taking into account two criteria: move as fast as possible and be safe. 

This estimation is based on two general cases: if the car is in a straight line, the target speed will take a maximum value (\textit{maxSpeed} km/h). However, if it is close to a curve, the controller will decrease the current speed to a value included in the interval \textit{[minSpeed, maxSpeed]} km/h.

This fuzzy controller has an output, the speed, and three input values:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Front = Track[9]: front distance to the track border (angle 0º).
	\item M5 = max (Track[8], Track[10]): max distance to the track border in an angle of +5º and -5º with respect to Front.
	\item M10 = max (Track[7], Track[11]): max distance to track border in an angle of +10º and -10º.
\end{itemize}

It is a Mamdani-based fuzzy system \cite{iancu2012} with three trapezoidal Membership Functions (MF) for every input variable. The description of these fuzzy inputs and output are represented in Table \ref{tab:flouevar}.

\begin{table}
		{\scriptsize
	\caption{Fuzzy variables description.}
	\label{tab:flouevar}
	\begin{tabular}{ |p{1.5cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2 cm}|p{1 cm}|p{1.5 cm}|p{1.5 cm}|}
		\hline
		{ \textbf{Variable}}&
		{ \textbf{Range}}&
		{ \textbf{Name}}&  
		{ \textbf{MF}} &
		{ \textbf{Low}} &
		{ \textbf{Medium}}&
		{ \textbf{High}} \\
		\hline
		Input & [0-100] m & Front & trapezoidal & [0-50] & [20-80] & [60-100]
		\\
		\hline
		Input & [0-100] m & M5 & trapezoidal &[0-40] & [10-70] & [50-100] 
		\\
		\hline
		Input & [0-100] m  & M10 & trapezoidal & [0-30] & [20-60] & [50-100]
		\\
		\hline 
		Output & [0-200] m/s & TargetSpeed & singleton & / & / & /
		\\
		\hline 
	\end{tabular} 
}
\end{table}

The base of rules was composed modelling the behaviour of a human expert driver. Thus, this set is designed to maximize the car speed depending on the distance to the track border. The fuzzy rules are:


\begin{itemize}
{\small
	\item \texttt{IF Front is High THEN TargetSpeed is TS1}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Medium THEN TargetSpeed is TS2}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low and M5 is High THEN TargetSpeed is TS3}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low and M5 is Medium THEN TargetSpeed is TS4}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is High THEN TargetSpeed is TS5}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Medium THEN TargetSpeed is TS6}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Low THEN TargetSpeed is TS7}\\
}

In addition, a crisp rule is added to obtain a maximum value of the target speed when the three input variables are as big as possible:\\
{\small	
\item \texttt{IF Front = MAXDISTSPEED or M5 = MAXDISTSPEED or M10 = MAXDISTSPEED THEN TargetSpeed = MAXSPEED}
}
\end{itemize}

MAXDISTSPEED is the longest possible value for the track sensors, and MAXSPEED is the maximal speed for the specific car. 
The output value is encoded by seven singletons TS1 to TS7, being respectively: 280, 240, 220, 180, 120, 60 and 30.

%-----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Fuzzy steering control sub-controller}	

The second fuzzy controller aims to control the steering, estimating and determining the target position of the car. 

The structure of this sub-controller is similar to the speed one, but, obviously, with the steering as output. Thus, the set of sensors considered is the same as in the speed case (in Table \ref{tab:flouevar}).

Then, as general rules: if the car is in a straight line, it will set as target position half width of the race track (central position of the lane). Whereas, if the car is near a right curve, it will approach the path leading to the right, with a space between the car and the border of the track to avoid the loss of control. The same approach is considered if the car is near a left curve.

In order to detect the curves, the controller focuses on the sensor values (M10, M5, and Front). So, if the value on Front sensor is the longest, there is a straight road; whereas if the values of M5 and M10 with positive angles (+5 and +10) are the longest, there is right curve; and the other way round.

The base of rules has been defined again modelling the behaviour of a human driver, so, for this controller:

{\small
\begin{itemize}		
	\item \texttt{IF Front is High THEN steer is S1}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Medium AND M10 is High THEN  steer is S2}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Medium AND M10 is Medium AND M5 is Medium THEN steer is S2}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Medium AND M10 is Medium AND M5 is Low THEN steer is S3}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low AND M10 is High THEN steer is S3}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low AND M10 is Medium AND M5 is Medium THEN steer is S4}
	\item \texttt{IF Front is Low AND M10 is Medium AND M5 is Low THEN steer is S4}
\end{itemize}	
}

The values for S1 to S4 are respectively: 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.
When M10=Track[7] we will take negative values of the steer (steer=-steer).

These controllers were defined with our own criteria, but they could be far from being optimal, so, in the following section we apply a Genetic Algorithm for their improvement.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  OPTIMISING WITH GAS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
\section{Optimizing the fuzzy controllers with GA}
\label{sec:GA_optimization}

Designing an optimal fuzzy controller for TORCS racing needs a human expert to define the membership functions parameters and the rule base. This expert, even if he exists, could not provide an exact repartition of the fuzzy membership functions values over the universe of discourse. 

This difficulty have led us to move towards the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) \cite{GAs_Goldberg89} because of their global exploration characteristic in a complex environment, as this problem plots.

The proposed optimization approach aims to find the optimal parameters of the membership functions of the two sub-controllers previously introduced. 

The followed process is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ga}, in which, as it can be seen, the GA uses TORCS for the evaluation of every individual during the evolutionary process.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\label{fig:ga}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=11cm]{fig/flowchart}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Optimization of a fuzzy controller flowchart. The evaluation of an individual is performed by: putting the parameter values on the two sub-controllers, launching a race in TORCS with this configuration, obtaining the resulting values of Damage, Top Speed and best Lap Time and using these values for the computation of the fitness of the individual.}
% Antonio - I would change 'Client' by 'Controller' or 'Driver' (Mohammed? Pablo?)
\end{figure}	

Indeed, the GA starts by creating the initial population with random values for the parameters in the defined range $[0,100]$. The fitness of each candidate solution is computed by injecting its gene values to the parameters of the membership functions of the two fuzzy sub-controllers. The defined autonomous controller is used to drive a car in a 20 laps race in TORCS 
% Antonio - Mohammed, qué tipo de carrera? con rivales? sin rivales? en una pista únicamente? que tipo de pista? por qué esa pista?
and the results (Top speed, Damage, and Race time) 
% Antonio - Mohammed, Lap time o race time? En la figura pone LapTime.
are used to compute the fitness value.

%***********************************************
\subsection{Genetic Algorithm settings}
%
As previously stated, the designed fuzzy controllers have trapezoidal membership functions given by \ref{eq:trapmf}.
In such a controller, fuzzy rules are applied to linguistic terms. These terms, which qualify a linguistic variable, are defined through membership functions, which, in turn, depend on a set of parameters that `describes' their shape (and operation).

The parameters to be optimized are those of all the membership functions that constitute the fuzzy partition of the linguistic variable \cite{ThangG08}.

The input linguistic variables in our problem, \textit{Front, Max5} and \textit{Max10}, are represented by three trapezoidal membership functions (See Table \ref{tab:flouevar}).

A trapezoidal membership function in a finite universe of discourse \textit{[a, b]} can be defined by:

\begin{equation}
\mu_{A}(x)= \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{x - x_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}},& x_{1} \leq x \leq x_{2}\\
1 , &x_{2} \leq x \leq x_{3}\\
\frac{x_{4} - x}{x_{4} - x_{3}},& x_{3} \leq x \leq x_{4}\\
0        ,& else\\	
\end{array}
\right.
\label{eq:trapmf}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
x_{1} \leq x_{2} \leq x_{3} \leq x_{4}
\end{equation}
This MF function is defined by four parameters $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$ taking their values in the interval \textit{[a, b]} (See Figure \ref{fig:trapeze}).																			
\begin{figure}[!ht] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig/trapese}
		\caption {Trapezoidal MFs}
		\label{fig:trapeze}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

More generally, a fuzzy partition with \textit{n} trapezoidal membership functions is defined by \textit{2n} variables (\textit{a =} $ x_{1}$,$x_{2} $,. .., $x_{2n} $ \textit {= b})(Equation \ref{eq:e1}). In this case, the representation is given by the figure \ref{fig:at}
\begin{figure}[!ht] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{fig/trapezoidal.png}
		\caption {Trapezoidal-shaped MFs coding}
		\label{fig:at}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
with:
\begin{equation}
a = x_{1} \leq x_{2} \leq...\leq x_{2n-1} \leq x_{2n}=b 	
\end{equation}		

\begin{equation} 
\begin{tabular}{l}
$\mu_{A1}(x)=  \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
1, &x_{1} \leq x \leq x_{2}\\
\frac{x_{3} - x}{x_{3} - x_{2}}, &x_{2} \leq x \leq x_{3}\\
0        , &x > x_{3}\\
\end{array} 
\right.$		\\ 	
$\mu_{Ai}(x)= \left \{

As we have just seen, a linguistic variable is represented by a number of parameters that depend both on the number and type of used membership functions  \cite{ThangG08}. Also the choice of coding to use for these different parameters depends both on the desired precision on the values and on their range of values.

When the number of parameters is reduced and their ranges of variations are well defined, a GA with a binary coding is largely sufficient to find their optimal values. On the other hand, if the number of parameters becomes important, and their variation interval is not well known, the real coding is the most appropriate \cite{elsayed13}. 
Since our work requires some precision and the variation interval of each parameter is not well known, we have considered a real coding implementation.

In that GA, every individual is a vector of 18 values/parameters, 6 per variable. Figure \ref {fig:cromosome} illustrates the structure of the chromosome.

The initialization of the chromosomes (first population) is performed assigning random values inside a range of variation \cite{GAs_Goldberg89}, in order to start from feasible values \cite{evo17_blind}.
Tournament based selection has been used to elect chromosomes as parents for genetic operators, while simple arithmetic two point crossover and non uniform mutation \cite{GAs_Goldberg89} have been chosen.
% Antonio - Mohammed: we should include a reference to any operator. Moreover, it would be great if we can justify why these operators have been selected (instead of others).

\subsection{Fitness definition}

The fitness function for optimizing the structure of a fuzzy controller is highly dependent on the application in which the controller is involved. It is therefore not possible to give a general formulation of this function able to adapt to all the peculiarities of a problem. However, we can specify some rules to choose the best evaluation function \cite{elsayed13}.

The fuzzy controller should aim to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Minimize the damage of the car $damage$.
	\item  Minimize the overall race time $RaceTime$.
	\item  Maximize the TopSpeed $MaxSpeed$.		
\end{itemize}

From this goals, we can derive two possible fitness functions:

\begin{description}
	\item[Fitness 1:]  
	\begin{equation} \label{fit1}
	\begin{array}{lllll}
	%f_{cout} =  $min$ & \alpha & $. damage$ + & $min$ &\beta & $. temps$ 
	f_{1} =  Min & damage + &\alpha \dot Min & RaceTime 
	\end{array}
	\end{equation}
	\item[Fitness 2:] 
	\begin{equation} \label{fit2}
	\begin{array}{llllll}
	%f_{cout}= min &\alpha & $. dammage$ + & min &\beta & $. temps$ + & min &\gamma & .\frac{1}{vitesse}
	f_{2}= Min & damage + &\alpha \dot Min & RaceTime + & Min & \beta \frac{1}{MaxSpeed}
	\end{array}
	\end{equation}	
\end{description}

Being $\alpha$ and $\beta$ two weighting parameters to prioritize the importance of the different objectives.
To evaluate the candidate controllers during the evolutionary process, we will make each of them compete in a 20 laps race in a medium difficulty circuit against a medium level rival.
% Antonio - Mohammed: which kind of race (practice or with rivals)? which kind of track? why this track?, which conditions (weather)?, which rivals?
%           This is very important to be mentioned and explained (why have these %           features been selected to correctly evaluate a controller). ;)
Then, the obtained output values ($damage$, $RaceTime$ and $MaxSpeed$) are collected to compute the corresponding fitness value.

  		
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  SIMULATION RESULTS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
\section{Simulation Results}
	\label{sec:results}
	
This section is dedicated to the performance evaluation of our fuzzy-genetic controller, called \textit{FGC}.
	We first, describe the methodology we have used and next, we present the experimental results of the optimization of the fuzzy-genetic driver and using special criteria in each case.
% Antonio - Mohammed: what are the special criteria?

%***********************************************
\subsection{Simulation settings}
	
	TORCS provides several tracks and cars to choose between. In our case, we have selected the E-Track5 circuit as it is a quite complex one (it has multiple turns). \textit{car1-tbr1} car has been considered as a rival in that track of SCR 1 Server \cite{evo17_blind}. According to previous experiments, this is a quite tough competitor which will lead our controller to be improved to deal with difficult opponents.
% Antonio - Mohammed: is that the rival for all the evaluation?

We have evaluated the fuzzy-genetic controller with the two proposed fitness functions, in order to see which one is appropriate to give the best performances. Thus, we have considered the following bots in the experiments:
	
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GFC1}: GA-Fuzzy controller with fitness 1 (Equation \ref{fit1}).
\item \textbf{GFC2}: GA-Fuzzy controller with fitness 2 (Equation \ref{fit2}).
\item \textbf{AD}: Fuzzy controller \cite{evo17_blind}.
\end{itemize}

20 runs of the GA have been conducted in each case, with the configuration shown in Table \ref{tab:GA_config}.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	\begin{table}[!ht]	
		\centering
		\caption{GA parameters}
		\label{tab:GA_config}

			\hline          
		\end{tabular}	
              \end{table}
            
As an example, the evolution of the best Fitness 2 ($f_2$) in the run of the best individual, is presented in Figure \ref{fig:fit2}. It can be clearly seen how the GA converges to the optimal solution along the generations.
% Antonio - Maybe we should also show an example of the evolution of Fitness 1

      \end{figure}
      
After the GA ended obtaining the optimal solution, we represented the resulted membership functions of the best individuals considering the different fitness functions in Figures \ref{fig:mffront}, \ref{fig:mfmax5} and \ref{fig:MFMAX10}.
% These should be examples of results. You can't publish results with a single experiment - JJ

\subsection{GA-Fuzzy  controller in practice race} 

The genetic based fuzzy controllers obtained from the last section are tested in a practice race where these two evolved controllers, named $GFC1$ and $GFC2$, together with the initial fuzzy controller, $AD$, will run each one for 20 laps in E-Track5 circuit (the one used during the evolution) and after they will be tested also in apractice race in an unknown track for them as E-Road. The obtained results are in Table \ref{resultat20}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\caption{Results of the three controllers in a 20 laps practice race}
	\label{resultat20}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{2.75 cm}|p{2.75cm}|p{2.75cm}}

		\hline 
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
% Antonio - TO DO: improve the format and size of this table.

From the table, we can see that the fuzzy controllers optimized by genetic algorithms have given the best results minimizing the global race time and damages ($0$ in  the two GA based fuzzy controllers ) while the AD controller has finished the practice race with some damages.
We notice also that the GFC controller has run with a higher top speed then GFC1. This is due to the inclusion of TopSpeed in the fitness confirming that GFC2 is the best controller.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{GA-Fuzzy controllers in a real race}

Every fuzzy controller has been tested separately from the others in real race against five standard controllers from each team integrated with TORCS. Tables \ref{tab:gfc1real}, \ref{tab:gfc2real} and \ref{tab:adreal} illustrate their performance in a 5 laps real race.

We note that the obtained ranking by the controllers $GFC1$,   $GFC2$ was third and second respectively. 
While  the point of view of race time, GFC2 has a better time than GFC1. For the damage, GFC1 and GFC2 finished the race without recording any damage On the other hand, the AD controller was not able to avoid high damages in the track.
% Antonio - TO DO: improve the analysis of results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  CONCLUSIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions and Future Work} 
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we presented a genetic approach to optimize and improve an existing fuzzy driver for TORCS simulator, which combines two sub-controllers, one to calculate the target speed and the other for the direction (steer).
In the evolution approach, we tested two fitness functions, one with the Best Time, the car damage and the other one consider also the top speed.
The fuzzy-genetic controllers thus obtained were compared with the original AD controller and whose parameters are determined empirically, the comparison was made first without opponents and then, with cars from the TORCS teams.
The obtained results are interesting in the context where the designed controllers were ranked among the first ones in the evaluation races, with the minimum of damage.

Nevertheless, these results can be improved by extending the evaluation of population controllers in the Genetic algorithm to other tracks and not just one to allow the elected controller to practice effectively in multiple tracks and in real-life situations.
In other hand, we can also try to optimize and tune automatically the rule base of the fuzzy controller.
